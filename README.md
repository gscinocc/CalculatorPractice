This is a basic calculator app inspired by https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/javafx/javafx-basic-exercise-7.php 
Instead of the user entering their own numbers, I have adjusted the program to work by clicking buttons for each step. 
This calculator is an excerise for me to independently learn how JavaFx interacts with Intellij
